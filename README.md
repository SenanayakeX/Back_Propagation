# ‚≠êBack Propagation

Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used in training artificial neural networks. It is a method for calculating the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's weights, which are then used to update the weights in the direction that minimizes the loss. This process is repeated multiple times, allowing the network to gradually improve its predictions until a satisfactory level of accuracy is achieved. Backpropagation is a key component in the training of deep learning models and is widely used in various applications, including image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train artificial neural networks by updating the network's weights to minimize the prediction error. The algorithm works by propagating the error back through the network, from the output layer to the input layer, and adjusting the weights along the way. The adjustments are made based on the gradients of the error with respect to the weights, which are calculated using the chain rule of differentiation.

Here's a simple illustration of how backpropagation works:

- The neural network makes a prediction based on the input data and the current weights.

- The error between the predicted output and the actual output is calculated.

 - The gradients of the error with respect to the weights are calculated using the chain rule of differentiation.

 - The weights are updated based on the gradients and a learning rate, which determines the size of the update.

 - Steps 1-4 are repeated multiple times, with the error decreasing and the weights being adjusted until the error reaches a satisfactory level.

This process allows the neural network to gradually improve its predictions over time, leading to more accurate results. Backpropagation is widely used in various applications of deep learning, including image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
